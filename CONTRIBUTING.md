## Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of what your changes do and why.
- Reference any related issues (e.g. `Closes #12`).
- Make sure your code doesn't break existing functionality.
- Be open to feedback and requested changes during review.

- Follow the existing conventions used in the project.
- Comment your code where necessary, especially for complex logic.
